# platform
A 2D platform game (kind of) written using godot engine.

This does not actually intent to be a playable game (or at least not a fun one). It is a collection of features that I wanted to implement using godot. 


# features
- [X] 2D playable character
- [ ] Physics applied to the character
- [X] Initial platform with proper collisions between character/world
- [ ] Some kind of "enemy" (whereas we would implement hurt and hitboxes)
- [ ] Proper tilesets so that it gets easier to generate new levels
- [ ] Create a second level and a way of transitioning between them
- [ ] Procedurally generated levels (infinite level generation)
- [ ] Some way of "dying". Which would take the characted back to the initial level and the subsequent levels would be regenerated. 

# nice to have but not the focus
- [ ] Implement animations for the playable character
- [ ] Draw tilesets that would generate the world
